Background
In the competitive telecom sector, customer attrition (churn) poses a major challenge to companies like NexWave, affecting their profitability and market position. This analysis investigates key factors influencing churn among NexWave customers, aiming to provide insights that can inform effective retention strategies.

Objective
This project focuses on identifying the primary factors driving customer churn for NexWave by analyzing customer demographics, service usage patterns, and account details. Tableau was used for visualizing insights, helping NexWave leadership quickly identify trends and take action.

Key Findings
Overall Churn Rate: The analysis determined that 26.86% of NexWave’s customers have churned. By creating calculated fields to detect unique customers and churned status, we verified this rate accurately represents NexWave’s current attrition.

Top Reasons for Churn: The primary reasons customers leave include better offers and devices from competitors, poor customer support interactions, and dissatisfaction with service offerings. "Competitor offers" accounted for a substantial portion of churn.

Churn by Location: California emerged as a hotspot with a churn rate of 63.24%, much higher than the typical 20-32% seen in other states. Additionally, 62.8% of churn records from California had missing churn reasons, warranting further investigation.

Demographic Insights: Age significantly affects churn rates, with senior citizens (60+) showing a higher tendency to churn (38.22% vs. 24.30% for other age groups).

Group Schemes: Customers in group plans exhibit significantly lower churn rates (5-8%) compared to those on individual plans (32.85%). Additionally, the lower monthly costs and fewer technical issues in group plans contribute to higher retention.

Unlimited Data Plans: Contrary to initial assumptions, customers without an unlimited data plan showed lower churn rates, particularly those using under 5GB per month.

International Plans: Customers with international plans but limited international activity show high churn rates (71.2%), indicating an opportunity to encourage plan downgrades for underused services.

Contract Types & Payment Methods: Monthly contract customers exhibit a 51% churn rate, suggesting that a trial mindset may lead to higher attrition. Paper cheque payment methods also correlate with higher churn, likely reflecting a casual commitment to NexWave’s services.

Account Tenure: Customers with over 30 months of tenure display a significantly lower churn rate, emphasizing the value of long-term customers.

Recommendations
Promote Group Plans: Offer incentives for customers to join group plans, as they show higher retention and satisfaction.
Optimize Plans Based on Usage: Tailor international and data plans to fit individual usage, encouraging plan downgrades or upgrades as appropriate.
Encourage Yearly Contracts: Provide incentives for month-to-month contract holders to shift to longer-term plans.
Enhance Customer Support: Focus on improving support experiences, particularly in competitive markets like California.
This analysis equips NexWave with targeted insights to reduce churn by tailoring services to customer needs and preferences, helping improve customer loyalty and lifetime value.
